# 2. Dataset Information and Wrangling

To answer our first research question which examines if the load in ERCOT and PJM has increased over time, we collected historical hourly load data for 2010-2022 from the ERCOT and PJM websites respectively. The hourly load data for each market has been grouped by day and month for the time series analysis purpose. 


## 2.1 PJM Load Data

The PJM website provides metered hourly data which contain the net energy in megawatt-hours consumed by the service territories within the PJM RTO. The data is sourced from the electric distribution companies within PJM, reflecting the highest quality of metered load within their respective zones. The dataset includes values submitted by companies or estimated values generated by PJM in cases where company data is not available. For the analysis, metered hourly load data with 8760 observations for each year from 2010 to 2022 were downloaded and merged into one data frame. Additionally, the hourly data has been converted into daily and monthly datasets by taking the mean of every 24-hour and each month respectively for the time series analysis.

## 2.2 ERCOT Load Data 

To analyze what factors contribute to load in ERCOT over time, we compiled various demographic variables as well as other important energy system variables: average energy bill price (cents/kWh), percentage renewable generation, total population, percent minority population, and median income. For our analysis, we are assuming that Texas and ERCOT are similar enough to be equated. This is important to note because ERCOT does not technically encompass the entire state. Still, many variables considered here have much more robust and easily accessible data for Texas than the ERCOT service area. 

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) provided the average Texas energy bill prices for each year in our scope, broken down by consumption sector (residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation) and averaged across each. Because the total average is a function of the average prices for each sector, we chose to exclude the breakdowns and just use the total average to avoid multicollinearity. The percentage of renewable generation in Texas for the years 2010-2022 was calculated using the Net Generation 1990-2022 report provided by the EIA. The calculation took the sum of solar, wind, and hydroelectric generation divided by the total generation to get the portion of renewable generation for each year of interest.

# 3. Exploratory Analysis of Data

Figure X illustrates the distribution of electricity load between ERCOT and PJM for the years 2010-2022. The vertically flat box plot of ERCOT indicates low variability in the data, reflecting its role as an independent operator in Texas. In contrast, the wider spread of data in the PJM boxplot is consistent with its regional coverage over multiple states. The box plots provide a visual summary of load distribution, highlighting the differences in variability between the two operators, which can be attributed to their operational coverage and help determine load growth.

We calculated the annual load growth rate from 2010 to 2022 for ERCOT and PJM to understand if the electricity load has grown at the same rate across the two markets.
While ERCOT load shows relatively constant growth each year, the PJM load growth rate displays fluctuation. One thing in common is that both markets experienced a decrease in the load in 2020; the load in ERCOT and PJM have dropped by 0.81% and 4.06% respectively in 2020. This can be explained by the COVID-19 pandemic which paused a lot of social and economic activities. What’s interesting is the opposite direction of load change in 2012; whereas PJM load has increased by 5.33% which is the maximum growth rate for PJM between 2010 and 2022, ERCOT load has decreased by 2.96% in 2012 from the year before. ERCOT observes the maximum growth rate in 2022, increasing by 9.47% from 2021. Overall, the total average annual growth rate is 2.58% for ERCOT and 0.96% for PJM. Hence, ERCOT has experienced more growth in electricity load from 2010 to 2022 than PJM has. 


## 4.3 Simple Linear Regression of PJM

**HYPOTHESIS**

The analysis of load growth is influenced by various factors, including those related to demand, energy-efficient technology, and energy consumption across different sectors along with market dynamics and policy regulation. Linear regression was conducted to model the relationship between price and both real-time (Figure X) and day-ahead load (Figure X). Based on the analysis of load in comparison to price, results show that growth is influenced by a diverse set of variables beyond price.

The results of the linear regression model and correlation test using real-time data for PJM indicate a statistically significant relationship between price and load based on the low p-value and significant tau value. However, the low r-squared value and small correlation coefficient show that only a small variance in load is explained by price showing other factors are important.

The linear regression model and correlation test were conducted using day-ahead data for PJM. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship between price and load based on the low p-value, significant tau value, and positive correlation coefficient. However, the low r-squared value suggests that only a small variance in load is explained by price showing other factors are important. 

## 4.4 Multiple Linear Regression of ERCOT

**HYPOTHESIS**

To begin this analysis, we used Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to determine which explanatory variables should be used to prevent over fitting of the data. Table X outlines the results of this test. The lowest AIC value achieved was 173.58 with the average bill price and percent renewables as the chosen variables. This result can be confirmed by observing the correlation plot for the explanatory variables (Figure X).
 
\centering Table : ERCOT Multiple Regression AIC Values \centering 

| Variables                                                              | AIC Value |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mean_Load + population + percent_renew + med_income + percent_minority | 178       |
| average_price_tot + population + percent_renew + med_income            | 176.04    |
| average_price_tot + percent_renew + med_income                         | 174.26    |
| average_price_tot + percent_renew                                      | 173.58    |

```{r Corr Plot}

```

The multiple linear regression using average bill price and percent renewables as the explanatory variables for mean load in ERCOT has an adjusted R2 value of 0.9616, meaning that 96.16% of the variance in average daily load can be explained by the explanatory variables. The p-value of this regression also indicates that the results of this model are statistically significant (p < 0.001, df = 10, F = 151.1). Table X shows the results of this regression. Assuming an alpha of 0.05, all variables are statistically significant, with percent renewables having the strongest significance with a p-value of 0.0001. For every 1% increase in renewable generation, there is a 358.75 MWh increase in average daily load. This is an interesting conclusion with no definitive explanation. It may have to do with the psychology around using more of a resource because it has a lower impact on the environment; for example, if someone has a solar heating system, they may take hot showers for longer because they feel that their energy consumption is cleaner. It could also be more of a technological advancement correlation since society is consuming more energy as we advance, and advancements in technology have resulted in more renewable energy to be captured (bigger wind turbines, more efficient solar panels, etc.) Overall, this finding warrants more study into this particular area.

We can also conclude that for every $1 increase in average bill price, there is a 1976.77 MWh increase in average daily load. Upon reflection, this last interpretation should likely have its causation reversed; instead, for every 1976.77 MWh added to the average daily load, there is a $1 increase in average bill price. This would make more sense because as load increases, more expensive generating plants need to be utilized, causing utility companies to have to charge higher rates to make a profit.

Figure X shows the residuals vs. fitted values, and Figure X shows the Q-Q residuals. These plots demonstrate the goodness of fit of the model. The residuals vs. fitted plot shows the distance of the residuals from the line of fit; it is important to ensure that these values are symmetric for a good fit, and this is the case with our model. The Q-Q plot points should stay close to the 1:1 line, and this is mostly true with our model as well, with some diversions towards the end with points 9 and 10.
